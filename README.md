## How to get the .pbf file
To use `r5r` we are going to need what's called a .pbf file.

To clip the downloaded .pbf file to our study area we need to get the appropriate .exe file from https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmconvert, copy it to the folder where our .pbf file is stored, and follow the instructions.
