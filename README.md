# ERSA2022 Demo
 
 ## Hi there!
 Hi there! Thank you for accessing this repository. The repo includes all the code and figures generated for this demonstration. Files are organised in a -hopefully- descriptive way. Files ending in `.ipynb` and `.R` contain the Jupyter Notebooks and R scripts used in each different phase of the demo. The file `environment.yml` allows you to import all the Python libraries you'll need to reproduce this code.
 
This is a demo version of my PhD project created for ERSA Summer School 2022. The demo focuses on the city of Caen (France), and it is only a preliminary test of some of the algorithms that will be implemented in future research. These results are not peer-reviewed, so proceed with caution when using them in your analyses.

Finally, if you have any suggestions to improve the code or the methodology, please feel free to contact me. Thank you very much.
